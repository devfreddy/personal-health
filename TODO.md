# To Do 


## December 22nd, 2025 - Protocol adjustments

For the next iteration of fine tuning the supplements, mental health, etc. and using the genetic health data.
Download from previous project and add some additional notes:

- [x] Add to a daily routine - breathing exercises through nose
- [x] Remove GABA and L threonate, never had these
- [x] Remove sulfurophane (gone now, too expensive, examine later)
- [x] Titrating down escitalopram by just a little (its been 4 weeks of this), 3 days of 5mg, and 4 days of 10mg
- [ ] Document breakdown of multi-vitamin
- [ ] Write decades long history of the crashes in the afternoon, describe dad's similar but different/more concise experience
- [ ] Document labs with function health
- [ ] Capture medical records from medent
- [x] Document timeline of experimenting with methylfolate starting in october, having 4-6 weeks of relative consistency in November and December
- [x] Move creatine to 5g a day via micronized powder (gummies were not cost effective and took too many of them to get to 5g)
- [ ] List products in use, in detail, broken down
- [x] Have Claude find and capture research on different supplements and protocols
- [ ] Have Claude analyze frequency and volume of supplements and look for combinatory issues
- [x] Build in a day a week or a weekend a month where we remove everything
- [x] Add in 1 time every 6 months to stop taking everything for a few days, and then gradually add back as is needed, sort of a protocol reset. Specifically the methylfolate, most other things can probably remain the same.
- [ ] Document caffeine as a supplementary for breaking me out of feeling unambitious
- [x] Add Green Tea to the regiment (documented research on how good this is)
- [ ] Come up with a plan and research for adding Rhodiola
- [x] Add Vitamin C in the morning
- [x] Differentiate between Depression, Energy, Ambition, Fear responses, write it down for future reference. Can have energy but no ambition, can be couch locked with fear. Should probably document what each 2:30pm event feels like.
- [x] Add in an activity for 1:30pm, like splashing cold water on face, or going for a walk, something to avoid the crash at 2/2:30pm
- [x] Continue PS but ensure its in the 5/6/7pm time frame to help modulate cortisol response, need to emphasize the timing important
- [x] Document breakfast and then a couple hours later adding nuts/fat, a snack of some kind to smooth energy levels out
- [x] Reduce NAC and move to evening only, too much NAC blunts energy and is just minorly supplemental.
- [x] Move fish oil to 3 capsules every evening, important not to take this morning and evening due to stressors it triggers
- [x] Increase Glycine quantity before bed, currently just taking default dose of 3g, but protocol calls for more 6g-10g. Don't go too far or it will cause an upset stomach.
- [x] Add sleep notes, if you wake up early, give it 30 min to fall back asleep, and if that doesn't work, just get up.
- [x] Document an ideal day
  - [x] Breakfast at 8:00
  - [x] Supplements at 8:15
  - [x] Shower by 8:30
  - [x] Snack & Tea at 10am
  - [x] Lunch at 1pm
  - [x] Activity at 1:30pm to break 2/2:30 cortisol drop
  - [x] Snack at 3/4pm
  - [x] Evening activities
  - [x] Dinner at 7/8pm along with PS
  - [x] Wind down supplements and routine
