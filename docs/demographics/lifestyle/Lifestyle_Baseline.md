## Notes & Observations

This baseline helps you understand what's normal for you and detect changes when you modify your protocol. It's especially valuable for understanding how closely your afternoon crash correlates with your protocol changes.

As noted in TODO.md, the 2:30 PM cortisol drop/energy crash is your KEY symptom to track - this document should help you identify all the factors that influence it.
