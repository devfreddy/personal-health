## Geographical History

Document locations where you've lived and worked, as these influence exposures (air quality, water, allergens, etc.):

### [Location Name/Timeline]
- **Period**: [Start year] - [End year]
- **Duration**: [X years]
- **Type**: [City/Suburb/Rural]
- **Notable Exposures**: [Relevant environmental factors]
- **Health Notes**: [Any health changes during this period]

**Example**:
- **Period**: 2000 - 2010
- **Location**: [City], [State]
- **Type**: Urban
- **Notable Exposures**: Industrial area, high air pollution
- **Health Notes**: Increased respiratory symptoms during this period

## Major Life Events

Significant events that may correlate with health changes:

### [Event Name]
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Type**: [Career change / Relocation / Relationship / Loss / Health event]

## Surgical History

### Major Surgeries
- **Adenoid Removal**: 1995 (childhood surgery)

### Minor Surgeries
- **Adenoid Removal**: 1995
- **Wisdom Teeth Extraction**: 2010
- **Lipoma Removal**: 2024 (10 lipomas removed; 15 more remain)

### Notes on Lipomas
- Presence of 25+ lipomas suggests possible underlying metabolic or lipid metabolism issue
- Correlates with hyperlipidemia diagnosis; may indicate genetic predisposition (check Genetic Genie detox profile)
- Remaining 15 lipomas: decide on monitoring vs. continued removal
