## 1. MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase)

### Gene Function and Biochemistry

**Location:** Chromosome 1p36.6

**Function:** MTHFR is a key regulatory enzyme in the one-carbon cycle that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a co-substrate for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. This enzyme is essential for folate metabolism, which is integral for DNA, RNA, and protein methylation.

### C677T Variant (rs1801133)

**Biochemical Impact:**
- Located at exon 4, results in conversion of valine to alanine at codon 222
- Creates a thermolabile enzyme with reduced activity at higher temperatures
- Enzyme activity reductions:
  - Heterozygous (CT): ~65-67% of normal activity
  - Homozygous (TT): ~25-30% of normal activity

**Homocysteine Levels:**
- Homozygous TT individuals have higher homocysteine levels
- Heterozygous CT individuals have mildly elevated homocysteine
- Effect is significantly modulated by folate status
- In low folate conditions (<15.4 nmol/L), TT genotype shows 24% higher homocysteine vs CC
- With adequate folate (≥15.4 nmol/L), no significant differences between genotypes

**Folate Requirements:**
- TT homozygotes may require 1.4 times higher folate compared to CC/CT genotypes

**Clinical Associations - Cardiovascular Disease:**

*Meta-Analysis Evidence:*
- Study of 38 case-control studies (6,310 patients, 8,297 controls)
- Significant associations with ischemic stroke:
  - Dominant model: OR 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06-1.12)
  - Recessive model: OR 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19-1.44)
- TT genotype associated with:
  - Overall stroke: OR 1.27 (95% CI: 1.04-1.56)
  - Thrombotic stroke: OR 1.37 (95% CI: 1.06-1.78)

*Mechanism:*
- TT homozygotes produce thermolabile enzyme with drastically reduced catalytic activity
- Results in elevated plasma homocysteine levels
- Hyperhomocysteinemia accelerates activation of coagulation factors V, X, and XII
- Increases risk of arterial thrombosis and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular diseases

*Joint Risk Factors:*
- Combined MTHFR C677T polymorphism and hypertension significantly increase stroke risk

**Clinical Associations - Cancer:**

*Digestive System Cancer (2024 Study):*
- CT carriers: 29% reduced risk (adjusted OR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.52-0.97, P=0.034)

- Current clinical guidelines:
  - American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)
  - American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)
  - American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG)
  - National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)
  - **Do NOT recommend routine MTHFR testing for pregnancy risk assessment or recurrent pregnancy loss evaluation**

*Important Note from Medical Guidelines:*
"The MTHFR mutations by themselves, in the absence of elevated homocysteine levels, are not a risk factor for cardiovascular disease or DVT and PE in countries where food is fortified with folic acid. They are not clotting disorders (thrombophilias). They do not lead to and are not associated with pregnancy complications, such as pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, and placental abruption."

## Methylation Cycle Biochemistry: Integration of These Genes

### One-Carbon Metabolism Overview

Vitamins B9 (folate) and B12 are essential water-soluble vitamins that drive a set of interconnected biochemical pathways for:
- Generating methyl groups
- DNA synthesis
- Amino acid homeostasis
- Antioxidant generation
- Epigenetic regulation

### The Folate and SAM "Bicycle"

**Connected Cycles:**
- Folate cycle and SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) cycle are connected in a "bicycle"
- Share common reaction catalyzed by vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase (MTR)

### Key Reactions

**Homocysteine Remethylation (Two Pathways):**

1. **Methionine Synthase (MTR) Pathway:**
   - Uses 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) from folate cycle as methyl donor
   - Requires vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) as cofactor
   - MTHFR converts 5,10-methyltetrahydrofolate → 5-MTHF
   - MTR converts homocysteine → methionine
   - MTRR reactivates MTR when it becomes inactive

2. **BHMT Pathway (Liver-Specific):**
   - Uses betaine as methyl donor
   - Converts homocysteine → methionine
   - Generates dimethylglycine
   - Accounts for up to 50% of homocysteine metabolism in liver

**Transsulfuration Pathway:**
- CBS catalyzes first step: homocysteine → cystathionine
- Requires vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-phosphate) as cofactor
- Regulated by SAM levels:
  - Low SAM → low CBS activity → homocysteine to transmethylation
  - High SAM → high CBS activity → homocysteine to transsulfuration
- Produces:
  - Cysteine (precursor for glutathione)
  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)

**SAH Hydrolysis:**
- AHCY converts S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) → adenosine + homocysteine
- Regulates intracellular SAH concentration
- Important for transmethylation reactions

### B12 Deficiency Effects

**Consequences:**
- Dietary methionine can still make SAM
- But homocysteine and N5-methyl THF accumulate
- Because both folate and SAM cycles are B12-dependent, B12 deficiency may result in secondary THF deficiency
- "Methyl trap" hypothesis: folate trapped as 5-MTHF

### Clinical Significance of Integrated Pathway

**Genetic variants in any of these genes can:**
- Disrupt homocysteine metabolism
- Alter methylation capacity
- Affect neurotransmitter metabolism (MAO-A, COMT)
- Impact vitamin D signaling (VDR)
- Influence disease susceptibility across multiple systems

---

## Summary of Current Clinical Guidelines

### Testing Recommendations

**NOT Recommended for Routine Screening:**
- MTHFR C677T and A1298C (per ACMG)
- MTHFR for pregnancy complications or recurrent pregnancy loss (per ACOG, NSGC)

**When Testing May Be Considered:**
- Confirmed elevated homocysteine with clinical need for intervention
- Family history of rare metabolic disorders (CBS deficiency, AHCY deficiency)
- Unexplained severe clinical presentations consistent with enzyme deficiencies

### Nutrition and Lifestyle Interventions

**Folate Fortification:**
- In countries with folate fortification, MTHFR variants have less clinical impact
- Adequate folate intake more important than genetic status

**Vitamin B6 Responsiveness:**
- Critical for CBS deficiency management
- Determines treatment intensity and prognosis

**Vitamin D:**
- VDR polymorphisms may influence response to supplementation
- Consider genetic variability in treatment planning

### Personalized Medicine Considerations

**Pharmacogenetics:**
- COMT variants may influence psychiatric medication response
- MAO-A variants associated with antidepressant response in females
- Individual variation in drug metabolism related to these pathways

**Pain Management:**
- COMT variants associated with pain sensitivity and fibromyalgia
- May inform individualized pain treatment approaches
