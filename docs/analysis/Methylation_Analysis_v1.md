## Executive Summary

Compound heterozygous MTHFR (C677T +/-, A1298C +/-) with ~50-60% normal enzyme activity. Multiple heterozygous variants in COMT, VDR, MTRR, and BHMT. Two homozygous variants: MAO-A R297R (+/+) and BHMT-08 (+/+).

## Critical Findings

### MTHFR Compound Heterozygosity (C677T +/- and A1298C +/-)

**Status**: 50-60% enzyme activity (similar to homozygous C677T)

**Effects**:
- Lower plasma folate
- Elevated homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia)
- Altered methylation capacity

**Health Associations**:
- Higher homocysteine → cardiovascular disease risk
- Reproductive: pregnancy complications, recurrent loss
- Neurological: autism, MS, Alzheimer's, bipolar disorder
- Other: fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, chemical sensitivity

**Targets**:
- Homocysteine <10 µmol/L (optimal <7)
- Methylfolate 400-1000 mcg
- Methylcobalamin daily
- B6, B12, folate monitoring

---

### COMT V158M Heterozygous (AG +/-)

**Status**: Intermediate enzyme activity and dopamine levels

**Effect**: Val allele breaks down dopamine 40% faster than Met/Met
- Val carriers: lower dopamine, better stress performance
- Met carriers: higher dopamine, "warrior" vs "worrier" pattern

**Your Status**: Balanced intermediate - flexibility under stress

**Associations**:
- Val allele overrepresented in fibromyalgia
- Affects pain sensitivity, mood, cognitive performance
- 30% lower COMT in women (estrogen inhibitory effect)

**Recommendations**:
- Monitor stress response
- Avoid excessive methyl donors if irritable
- Pain sensitivity awareness
- Stress management techniques

### MAO-A R297R Homozygous (TT +/+)

**Status**: Your only homozygous neurotransmitter gene

**Effect**: Slower breakdown of serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine
- Higher baseline neurotransmitter levels
- Greater sensitivity to neurotransmitter-affecting substances

**Combined with COMT +/-**: Can create pronounced neurotransmitter imbalances

**Associations**:
- Mood swings, anxiety
- OCD, aggressive behavior (if combined with COMT +/+)
- Major depressive disorder risk

**Recommendations**:
- Monitor mood stability
- Caution with neurotransmitter-affecting substances
- Omega-3 fatty acids for mood
- Discuss antidepressants/anxiolytics with provider

---

### BHMT-08 Homozygous (TT +/+)

**Effect** (per Dr. Amy Yasko):
- May increase MHPG relative to dopamine breakdown
- Attention-type symptoms
- Elevated glycine levels
- Similar effects to CBS upregulation

**Impact**: Greater reliance on primary methylation pathways (MTHFR support critical)

**Recommendations**:
- Monitor attention symptoms
- Glycine level testing if available
- TMG/betaine supplementation trial
- Methylation B vitamin support

---

### VDR Polymorphisms (Bsm +/-, Taq +/-)

**Role**: Vitamin D receptor for immune, bone, neurological function
- Vitamin D stimulates dopamine-creating enzymes

**Status**: Heterozygous for both (unusual but balanced)

**Interaction with COMT**: Creates moderate dopamine environment

**Recommendations**:
- Vitamin D target: 40-60 ng/mL
- D3: 2000-4000 IU daily (based on testing)
- Ensure adequate K2 with D3
- Monitor calcium

---

### MTRR Variants (Multiple Heterozygous)

**Variants**: A66G, H595Y, K350A, A664A (all +/-)

**Role**: B12 recycling for homocysteine-to-methionine conversion

**Effect**: Increased B12 requirements, methylation impact

**Combined with MTHFR**: Emphasizes B12 supplementation importance

**Recommendations**:
- Methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin 1000-5000 mcg daily
- Test methylmalonic acid (functional B12 marker)
- Consider sublingual or injectable forms
- Monitor homocysteine

---

### CBS C699T Heterozygous (AG +/-)

**Role**: First transsulfuration pathway step (homocysteine → cystathionine)

**Status**: Heterozygous = moderate function

**Note**: Medical research on CBS upregulation limited; clinical observations variable

**Possible Effects** (if upregulated):
- Rapid homocysteine conversion to taurine
- Sulfur intolerance
- Ammonia accumulation
- BH4 depletion

**Recommendations**:
- Monitor for sulfur sensitivity
- Molybdenum for sulfite oxidase support
- BH4 cofactor support
- Consider limiting high-sulfur foods if symptomatic

## Integrated Protocol

**Core Methylation**:
- Methylfolate: 400-800 mcg daily
- Methylcobalamin: 1000-5000 mcg daily
- P5P (B6): 25-50 mg daily
- Riboflavin (B2): 25-100 mg daily

**Additional**:
- Betaine/TMG: 500-1000 mg daily
- Vitamin D3: 2000-4000 IU daily
- Magnesium glycinate: 300-400 mg daily
- Omega-3: 1000-2000 mg EPA/DHA daily

**Neurotransmitter Support**:
- SAM-e: 200-400 mg (if tolerated; may increase dopamine)
- L-theanine: 100-200 mg for calming

---

## Dietary Focus

**Emphasize**:
- Dark leafy greens (folate)
- Eggs (choline, B vitamins)
- Wild fish (omega-3s, B12)
- Grass-fed meat (B12)
- Beets (betaine/TMG)
- Cruciferous vegetables (detox support)

**Moderate**:
- High-methionine foods if CBS sensitive
- Caffeine
- Alcohol
- High-temp cooked meats

---

## Lifestyle

- Stress management: moderate stress response with intermediate COMT
- Sleep: 7-9 hours nightly
- Exercise: moderate intensity preferred
- Minimize environmental toxins
- Avoid smoking, limit alcohol

---

## Testing Recommendations

**Baseline**:
- Homocysteine (target <10, optimal <7)
- B12 + methylmalonic acid
- Folate (serum and RBC)
- Vitamin D (25-OH)
- Complete blood count
- Comprehensive metabolic panel

**Advanced**:
- Organic acids (methylation metabolites)
- Neurotransmitter testing (if mood/cognitive issues)
- Oxidative stress markers
- Cardiovascular risk (lipids, hs-CRP)

## Important Caveats

- Variants are not deterministic; many factors influence outcomes
- Interpret in context of symptoms, history, labs
- Work with qualified nutrigenomics practitioners
- Field based on clinical observations, research evolving
