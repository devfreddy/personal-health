# Analysis Framework

Systematic approach to analyzing your health data, identifying patterns, and synthesizing recommendations based on genetics, clinical findings, and experimentation.

## Data Integration Model

### Three Core Data Streams

1. **Genetics** (docs/genetics/): Your biological foundation
   - MTHFR and methylation capacity
   - Detoxification enzyme variants
   - Absorption and metabolism factors

2. **Clinical Data** (docs/medical/): Your actual health status
   - Diagnosed conditions
   - Lab work and biomarkers
   - Current medications and supplements

3. **Lifestyle & Experimentation** (TIMELINE.md, EVENTS.md): Your real-world results
   - What works for you
   - Symptom patterns and triggers
   - Protocol effectiveness

### The Triangle: Genetics ↔ Labs ↔ Symptoms

Powerful insights emerge where these three data streams align:
- **Genetics predict** → Lab work confirms → Symptoms improve with intervention
- Example: MTHFR variants → Low B12/folate in labs → Brain fog improves with methylated supplements

## Key Analysis Questions

### 1. Genetic Foundation
- [ ] What are my key genetic variants? (MTHFR, detox genes, etc.)
- [ ] What do these variants predict about my metabolism?
- [ ] Which variants are most clinically relevant to my diagnosed conditions?
- [ ] Do my symptoms align with my genetic predispositions?

### 2. Clinical Correlation
- [ ] Are my lab values consistent with my genetic variants?
- [ ] Which biomarkers are outside normal ranges?
- [ ] Do any lab abnormalities explain my primary symptoms?
- [ ] Which labs should improve with my current protocol?

### 3. Intervention Effectiveness
- [ ] Which interventions have shown clear benefit?
- [ ] What's the timeline for seeing effects?
- [ ] Are there dose-response relationships I can identify?
- [ ] Are there unexpected benefits or side effects?

### 4. Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] What's not working that should be reconsidered?
- [ ] What gaps exist between genetics, labs, and symptoms?
- [ ] What low-cost, low-risk experiments could help?
- [ ] When should next lab work be done to assess progress?

## Synthesis Templates

### Genetic Variant Analysis

**Variant**: [e.g., MTHFR C677T]
- **Your Status**: Homozygous / Heterozygous / Wild-type
- **Expected Effect**: [What this variant typically causes]
- **Your Phenotype**: [How you actually experience this]
- **Lab Support**: [Lab values supporting or contradicting prediction]
- **Current Intervention**: [What you're doing about it]
- **Effectiveness**: [Is it working?]
- **Confidence Level**: [How confident are you in this analysis?]

---

### Symptom Pattern Analysis

**Symptom**: [e.g., Afternoon energy crash at 2:30 PM]
- **Onset**: [When did this start?]
- **Frequency**: [How often does it occur?]
- **Triggers**: [What makes it worse?]
- **Mitigating Factors**: [What helps?]
- **Genetic Factors**: [Relevant genetic variants]
- **Lab Support**: [Relevant biomarkers]
- **Current Protocol**: [What you're doing to address it]
- **Effectiveness**: [Is it improving?]
- **Next Steps**: [Adjustments to try]

---

### Protocol Effectiveness Assessment

**Protocol Element**: [e.g., Methylfolate supplementation]
- **Start Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Dosage**: [Dose and frequency]
- **Intended Effect**: [What should improve]
- **Observed Effects** (positive):
  - [Effect 1 and timeline]
  - [Effect 2 and timeline]
- **Observed Effects** (negative/neutral):
  - [Side effect or lack of effect]
- **Cost/Benefit**: [Is it worth continuing?]
- **Confidence in Effect**: [Is it the supplement or placebo?]
- **Next Steps**: [Keep, modify, or discontinue?]

## Analysis Process

### Monthly Review
1. Review EVENTS.md for observations
2. Check symptom tracking patterns
3. Assess protocol compliance and effectiveness
4. Plan any adjustments for coming month
5. Note anything to discuss with healthcare provider

### Quarterly Deep Dive
1. Analyze lab trends (if labs repeated)
2. Review all protocol changes and effects
3. Identify patterns in symptom timing
4. Assess whether genetic predictions are panning out
5. Plan next lab work or clinical consultations
6. Update Current_Protocol.md with validated changes

### Annual Comprehensive Analysis
1. Full integration of genetics, labs, and outcomes
2. Complete protocol evaluation and optimization
3. Decision on major changes or directions
4. Plan for coming year based on learnings

---

## Confidence Levels

When making conclusions, rate your confidence:
- **High Confidence** (>80%): Multiple data sources align, consistent patterns
- **Moderate Confidence** (50-80%): Some supporting evidence, need more data
- **Low Confidence** (<50%): Preliminary observation, needs validation
- **Anecdotal**: Single observation, no confirmation yet

This helps identify which areas need more testing vs. which are well-established for you.

## Limitations & Caveats

### Known Limitations of This Approach
1. **N=1 trials**: Personal experimentation can't control all variables
2. **Placebo effect**: Hard to separate true effects from placebo benefit
3. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Just because timing aligns doesn't mean causation
4. **Genetic interpretation**: Not all genetic variants have clear clinical significance
5. **Time lag**: Some interventions take weeks/months to show effects

### When to Consult Healthcare Providers
- New or worsening symptoms
- Before starting any new supplement
- Before discontinuing medications
- When labs are severely abnormal
- If experimentation isn't yielding expected results
