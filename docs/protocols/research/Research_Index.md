## Notes on Evidence Strength

When evaluating research:
- **Strong evidence**: Multiple RCTs, meta-analyses support
- **Moderate evidence**: Several good quality studies
- **Preliminary evidence**: Early studies, needs more research
- **Anecdotal**: Personal experimentation, n=1 trials

This helps distinguish between well-established interventions and experimental approaches.
