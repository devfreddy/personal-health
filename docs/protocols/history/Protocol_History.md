## Protocol Version History

### v1.5 - MTHFR Methylation + Sleep Optimization (Current - Transitioning to v2)
- **Version**: v1.5
- **Effective Date**: October 25, 2024 - January 5, 2025 (planned transition)
- **Duration**: ~2.5 months
- **Genetic Basis**: Compound heterozygous MTHFR (C677T +/-, A1298C +/-), CYP1B1 +/+, NAT2 +/+, MAO-A +/+, BHMT-08 +/+
- **Key Supplements**:
  - Methylfolate 2000mcg (effective ~3500mcg with 3g creatine)
  - Methylcobalamin 1800mcg + Adenosylcobalamin 200mcg (2000mcg total B12)
  - Magnesium Glycinate 1200mg distributed (5 doses: 200mg morning, 200mg midday, 200mg afternoon, 200mg evening, 400mg bedtime)
  - Phosphatidylserine 300mg (6-7 PM CRITICAL timing)
  - Glycine Powder 3-5g evening + 5-10g bedtime
  - Taurine 1000mg evening
  - NAC 600-1200mg (flexible, blunts daytime energy)
  - Creatine Monohydrate 3g daily
  - Melatonin 500mcg bedtime
  - GABA sublingual (emergency anxiety only, rarely used)
  - P5P 25mg, B2 25mg, TMG 200mg (via multivitamin)

- **Rationale**:
  - Genetic Genie analysis revealed compound heterozygous MTHFR causing ~50% enzyme activity
  - Impaired methylation = depression, energy crashes, poor sleep
  - Enhanced Phase I detoxification (CYP1B1) + slow Phase II (NAT2) requires robust glutathione support
  - Altered neurotransmitter metabolism (MAO-A) exacerbates depression
  - Distributed magnesium prevents evening depletion that triggers panic/anxiety
  - High-dose glycine + proper PS timing addresses sleep and cortisol dysregulation

- **Outcomes** (December 2024):
  - **Sleep**: Significantly improved, falls asleep easier, stays asleep most nights
  - **Panic/Anxiety at bedtime**: Resolved within first 1-2 weeks
  - **Heart pounding**: Resolved
  - **Afternoon crash (2:30 PM)**: Still occurring regularly - KEY UNRESOLVED SYMPTOM
  - **Mood stability**: Improved baseline, still working on recurrent depression
  - **Energy**: Generally stable, but afternoon crash remains
  - **Tolerance**: No tolerance development noted, consistent effectiveness over 2+ months
  - **Side effects**: Minimal; some initial adjustment in week 1-2

- **What Worked Well**:
  - Distributed magnesium approach - prevents evening depletion
  - PS timing at 6-7 PM - effective for cortisol modulation
  - Glycine at bedtime - immediate improvement in sleep quality
  - Creatine for methyl sparing - allowed lower methylfolate dose while maintaining effectiveness
  - Methylation support pathway - addresses root cause of mood instability

- **What Didn't Work Well**:
  - Creatine gummies - inefficient for 3g dose (too many to swallow)
  - NAC in morning - blunts daytime energy (moving to evening in v2)
  - Fish oil both morning + evening - triggers stress responses
  - Current glycine dose (3g) - suboptimal for sleep (need 6-10g)
  - No intervention for afternoon crash - still needs 1:30 PM activity component

- **Unexpected Benefits**:
  - Magnesium distribution - improved overall stress resilience beyond sleep
  - TMG/betaine - mood support beyond just methylation pathway
  - Taurine - noticeable calming effect + helps GABA
  - Methylation support - better mental clarity than expected (beyond just mood)

- **Reasons for Change to v2**:
  - Afternoon crash remains primary unresolved symptom
  - Methylfolate timing optimization working; now need behavioral intervention
  - Glycine dose suboptimal (3g vs. target 6-10g)
  - Some supplements blunting daytime energy (NAC, fish oil timing)
  - 4+ weeks on escitalopram allows confidence to further optimize other pathways
  - Ready to add lifestyle interventions (breathing, 1:30 PM activity) for crash prevention

## Key Learnings from v1.5 Experience

### Genetic Implementation Insights
1. **Methylfolate Timing Critical**: Taking after 2 PM disrupts sleep - enforcing hard stop by 10 AM is non-negotiable
2. **Creatine Effectiveness**: 3g creatine effectively spares ~40% of SAM, allowing lower methylfolate dose while maintaining results
3. **Distributed Magnesium is Essential**: All-at-night dosing causes daytime depletion and anxiety. Four separate doses throughout day + higher evening dose is optimal
4. **Cortisol Modulation Window**: PS works best at 6-7 PM concentrated dose, NOT spread throughout day or at bedtime

### What Still Needs Solving
- **Afternoon Crash (2:30 PM)**: Remains primary unresolved symptom despite methylation support
  - Not purely energy - has emotional component (ambition loss, flatness)
  - Timing precise (2:30 PM window, NOT 2 PM or 3 PM)
  - Likely cortisol pattern despite PS intervention
  - Needs behavioral intervention (1:30 PM activity + breathing) to complement biochemical support

### Supplement Sequencing Learnings
- Early additions (methylfolate, B12, magnesium): Worked immediately with proper timing
- Medium additions (PS, glycine, taurine): Showed clear benefit within 2-3 weeks
- Problem additions: NAC morning (blunts energy), fish oil both times (stress trigger)
- Lesson: Don't add everything at once; test timing and dosing carefully

### Cost-Effectiveness Findings
- Creatine monohydrate powder >> gummies (cost effective at 5g/day)
- Glycine powder >> capsules (cost effective at 6-10g/day)
- Methylation multivitamin: Good value at 2 capsules daily
- NAC: Worth keeping but evening-only (less cost concern, dosing flexible)

### Safety & Tolerance
- v1.5 extremely safe - no serious adverse events over 2.5 months
- Tolerance not an issue with consistent, distributed dosing
- High magnesium (1200mg) well-tolerated in glycinate form
- Glycine: Monitor for stomach upset above 10g (most people fine 6-10g)

## Future Protocol Hypotheses (for v3+)

Based on v1.5 results and ongoing research:

1. **Afternoon Crash Root Cause**: Likely combination of:
   - Cortisol dysregulation (despite PS intervention)
   - Blood sugar crash (need breakfast + fat/nut snack timing)
   - Magnesium depletion pattern (despite distributed dosing)
   - Adenosine buildup (circadian rhythm dip)
   - Behavioral/environmental triggers (stress, posture, lack of movement)

   **v2 will test**: 1:30 PM activity + breathing exercises as primary intervention

2. **Escitalopram Interaction**: SSRI stabilizes mood but doesn't address energy crashes
   - May need continued dose adjustment
   - Methylation support helps SSRI effectiveness
   - Consider if SSRI dose related to afternoon crash

3. **Lipoma/Hyperlipidemia Connection**: 25+ lipomas + high cholesterol suggests:
   - CYP1B1 detox issues (Phase I over-activity)
   - NAT2 slow acetylation limiting Phase II
   - Possible estrogen metabolism issue (4-OH vs 2-OH balance)
   - v2: Monitor estrogen metabolites if labs become available

4. **Breathing & Nervous System**: Preliminary hypothesis that nasal breathing + box breathing may address cortisol crash better than supplements alone
   - Will test systematically in v2

## Archive Note

v1.5 represents successful implementation of genetic-informed methylation protocol with strong sleep outcomes. Primary remaining challenge is afternoon energy/motivation crash, which v1.5's biochemical approach did not fully resolve. v2 will integrate behavioral interventions (1:30 PM activity, breathing) with biochemical optimizations (increased glycine, moved NAC/fish oil timing, creatine 5g).

When protocol changes continue, add new versions above, keeping this comprehensive v1.5 record for reference and future pattern analysis.
