# v2 Protocol Draft - Planned for January 2025 Implementation

Refined protocol based on v1.5 experience, TODO.md refinements, and ongoing experimentation.

## Key Changes from v1.5 to v2

### Supplement Adjustments

**Increases:**
- Creatine: 3g → 5g (via micronized powder, cost-effective)
- Glycine: 3g → 6-10g bedtime (titrate carefully, monitor stomach)

**Timing Changes:**
- NAC: Flexible/morning → Evening only (v1.5 showed it blunts daytime energy)
- Fish oil: Remove morning dose → 3 capsules evening only (morning+evening combo triggers stress)

**Additions:**
- Vitamin C: Morning routine (support immune + NAC synergy)
- Green Tea: Daily routine (documented research on antioxidants + focus)
- Caffeine: Document strategic use as supplement for breaking unambitious feeling (not depression - distinct symptom)
- Breathing exercises: Daily nasal breathing + 1:30 PM activity (critical for cortisol crash)

**Research & Pending:**
- Rhodiola: Research and plan for energy/stress support (not yet added - needs research)
- Sulforaphane: Keep discontinued (too expensive, low ROI)
- GABA: Remove from active list (never actually used)
- L-Theanine: Remove from active list (never actually used)

### Lifestyle Restructuring

**1:30 PM Activity (CRITICAL):**
- Purpose: Break the 2:30 PM cortisol dip/energy crash pattern
- Options: Cold water splash on face, walk, stretching, movement
- Frequency: Daily (non-negotiable)
- Timing: Exactly 1:30 PM or 1 hour before crash onset

**Breathing Exercises:**
- Nasal breathing: Daily, continuous throughout day
- Box breathing: 4-4-4-4 pattern, 5-10 min sessions
- Long exhale breathing: 4 in, 6-8 out
- Frequency: Daily, especially 1:30 PM session
- Purpose: Nervous system regulation, prevent afternoon crash

**Ideal Daily Schedule (Documented):**
```
8:00 AM    - Breakfast
8:15 AM    - Morning supplements + creatine (5g new)
8:30 AM    - Shower
10:00 AM   - Snack + Tea (Green Tea new) + Nasal breathing
1:00 PM    - Lunch
1:30 PM    - CRITICAL ACTIVITY (walk, cold water, movement) + Breathing
3:00-4:00 PM - Afternoon snack
7:00-8:00 PM - Dinner + Evening supplements (NAC timing adjustment)
8:00-9:00 PM - Wind-down routine
10:00-10:30 PM - Sleep (bedtime with increased glycine 6-10g)
```

### Documentation Improvements

**Symptom Differentiation (Critical for v2):**
Document each 2:30 PM event specifically:
- **Depression/flatness**: Emotional numbness, difficulty engaging
- **Pure energy drop**: Fatigue, muscle weakness (no mood change)
- **Lack of ambition**: Can't make decisions, no drive (distinct from depression)
- **Fear responses**: Anxiety, avoidance patterns
- **Caffeine as intervention**: Strategic use when ambition/motivation lacking (not depression)

Each subtype may need different intervention. Tracking will reveal patterns.

**Afternoon Crash History:**
- Decades-long pattern (write full history)
- Father's similar but different/more concise pattern (document comparison)
- When did it start? What makes it worse? What helps?

**Multivitamin Breakdown:**
- Document exact contents of methylation multivitamin
- 2000mcg methylfolate: Source (5-MTHF), form
- 2000mcg B12: Methylcobalamin + Adenosylcobalamin split
- Other B vitamins: Exact forms and amounts
- Cofactors: TMG, B2, B6 forms

**Product Inventory (Detailed):**
- List each supplement with: brand, form, cost, effectiveness rating
- Track cost per dose for cost-effectiveness analysis
- Identify which provide best ROI

### Protocol Resets

**Weekly/Monthly Reset:**
- 1x/week partial reset day OR 1x/month weekend reset
- Remove some supplements (e.g., NAC, PS, extra magnesium)
- Keep core: methylation support, basic magnesium, glycine
- Purpose: Prevent tolerance, assess baseline, avoid dependency

**Quarterly/Annual Reset:**
- 1x/6 months full reset (stop everything 2-3 days, gradually add back)
- Specifically for methylfolate reassessment
- Purpose: Determine current methylation needs, avoid dosage creep
- Protocol: Stop all → observe baseline → add back one category at a time

### Fish Oil Adjustment

- **Previous**: Flexible timing (some morning + evening)
- **New**: 3 capsules evening only
- **Rationale**: Morning + evening combination was triggering stress responses
- **Target**: Continue omega-3 support without stress side effect

### Lab Work Planning

From v1.5 monitoring section, prioritize:
1. **Homocysteine** (optimal <7 µmol/L) - primary MTHFR marker
2. **Serum folate** (optimal >8 ng/mL)
3. **Vitamin B12** (optimal >500 pg/mL)
4. **Methylmalonic acid** (B12 function marker)
5. **Lipid panel** (hyperlipidemia + 25+ lipomas)
6. **Liver function** (ALT, AST, especially with increased supplementation)

**Timeline**: Get initial labs in early January, retest 6-8 weeks after v2 implementation

## Implementation Checklist

### Week 1 (January 1-5):
- [ ] Obtain micronized creatine powder (switch from gummies)
- [ ] Begin creatine 5g daily (increase gradually 3g → 4g → 5g over days)
- [ ] Add Vitamin C to morning routine
- [ ] Add Green Tea to daily routine
- [ ] Move NAC to evening only
- [ ] Move fish oil to 3 capsules evening only
- [ ] Document baseline for all symptoms
- [ ] Schedule lab work with PCP

### Week 2-3:
- [ ] Begin daily nasal breathing practice
- [ ] Establish 1:30 PM activity routine (choose: cold water, walk, stretching)
- [ ] Start documenting 2:30 PM crash subtypes in EVENTS.md
- [ ] Begin titrating glycine up from 3g → 4g → 5g → 6g+ (monitor stomach)
- [ ] Write out afternoon crash history
- [ ] Write out ideal daily schedule with timing

### Week 4+:
- [ ] Assess effects of each new addition
- [ ] Determine optimal glycine dose (target 6-10g, monitor tolerance)
- [ ] Document multivitamin breakdown
- [ ] Create detailed product inventory with costs
- [ ] Plan first reset protocol (1x/week partial reset)
- [ ] Continue daily EVENTS.md tracking

## Expected Outcomes (v2)

### Primary Goal: Eliminate 2:30 PM Crash
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks with consistent 1:30 PM activity + increased glycine
- **Success metric**: Crash reduced to <2x per week or <50% intensity
- **Contingency**: If still present, evaluate breathing technique, food timing, stress factors

### Secondary Goal: Optimize Glycine Dosing
- **Current**: 3g bedtime (suboptimal)
- **Target**: 6-10g bedtime
- **Timeline**: Titrate over 3-4 weeks
- **Monitoring**: Sleep quality, temperature regulation, stomach tolerance

### Tertiary Goal: Reduce NAC Side Effects on Energy
- **Current**: Morning NAC blunts daytime energy
- **Expected**: Evening-only NAC maintains detox support without energy impact
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks to notice improvement
- **Contingency**: Could reduce dose or discontinue if evening-only still problematic

### Quaternary Goal: Stabilize Mood While Escitalopram Titrating
- **Current**: Escitalopram titrating (3 days 5mg, 4 days 10mg)
- **Support**: Enhanced methylation (creatine 5g), green tea, breathing exercises
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for full assessment
- **Tracking**: Daily mood 1-10 scale, depression vs. energy vs. ambition vs. fear

## Questions for Further Research (v2 Planning)

1. **Rhodiola for Energy & Stress**: Safety with escitalopram? Optimal dose? Timing?
2. **Green Tea Dosing**: Optimal daily amount for focus/antioxidant benefits?
3. **Caffeine as Targeted Supplement**: Strategic use for ambition/motivation (vs. depression)? Best timing?
4. **Glycine Tolerance**: Why does high-dose glycine sometimes cause stomach upset? How to mitigate?
5. **Fish Oil Stress Response**: Why did morning+evening trigger stress? Omega-6/3 ratio issue? Dose too high?
6. **NAC Energy Blunting**: Mechanism? Related to glutathione changes?

## Protocol Reset Strategy

### Partial Reset (1x/week or 1x/month weekend):
**Friday evening**: Remove PS, NAC, extra magnesium (keep methylation + core magnesium + glycine)
**Saturday-Sunday**: Assess baseline without these
**Monday**: Resume full protocol
**Purpose**: Check tolerance, prevent tolerance development, cheaper way to assess

### Full Reset (1x/6 months):
**Day 1-3**: Stop all supplements (or just methylation + glycine for safety)
**Observe**: Baseline homocysteine response, mood stability, energy levels, sleep
**Days 4-10**: Add back gradually:
- Day 1: Methylation support only
- Day 2-3: Add magnesium
- Day 4-5: Add glycine
- Day 6-7: Add PS + other evening supplements
**Purpose**: Determine if current doses still needed, reset tolerance, identify critical vs. optional items

## Success Metrics for v2

Track these in EVENTS.md:

1. **Afternoon Crash**: Days with crash, intensity (1-10), time it occurs
2. **Sleep**: Bedtime, wake time, quality (1-10), early waking episodes
3. **Mood**: Daily rating 1-10, depression vs. energy vs. ambition vs. fear separated
4. **Energy**: Morning energy, afternoon energy, evening energy (1-10 each)
5. **Physical**: Mid-back tension (1-10), vastus lateralis pain (1-10), other pain
6. **Stress**: Stress level 1-10, stressor description, effect on symptoms
7. **Protocol adherence**: % days all items taken correctly, timing adherence
8. **Side effects**: Any new symptoms, tolerance issues, unexpected benefits
