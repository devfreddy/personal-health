## Daily Supplement Schedule (v1.5)

### Morning (7-9 AM with breakfast)

| Supplement | Dosage | Frequency | Genetic Target | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Methylation Multivitamin | 2 capsules | Daily | MTHFR | Provides 2000mcg methylfolate, 2000mcg B12, 25mg B2, 25mg P5P, 200mg TMG |
| Creatine Monohydrate | 3g | Daily | Methylation sparing | Spares ~40% of SAM, effective dose becomes ~3500mcg methylfolate |
| Magnesium Glycinate | 200mg | Daily | Overall methylation | First distributed dose of day |

**CRITICAL TIMING**: Methylfolate by 10 AM maximum (NEVER after 2-3 PM - it's stimulating and disrupts sleep)
**MEAL**: Take with breakfast (8:00 AM) to avoid stomach upset
**FUTURE ADJUSTMENT (v2)**: Increase creatine to 5g via micronized powder (replace gummies - cost ineffective)

---

### Midday (12-2 PM)

| Supplement | Dosage | Frequency | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Magnesium Glycinate | 200mg | Daily | Prevent afternoon depletion | Critical for methylation throughout day |

**MEAL TIMING**: Can take with lunch or between meals
**RATIONALE**: Prevents depletion as methylation uses magnesium all day; skipping this causes evening fight/flight

---

### Afternoon (4-5 PM)

| Supplement | Dosage | Frequency | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Magnesium Glycinate | 200mg | Daily | Maintain levels | Final daytime dose |

**NOTES**: Critical to prevent evening cortisol spike and bedtime panic

---

### Early Evening (6-7 PM with dinner)

| Supplement | Dosage | Frequency | Genetic Target | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Magnesium Glycinate | 200mg | Daily | Methylation/evening | Supports evening transition |
| Phosphatidylserine (PS) | 300mg | Daily | Cortisol modulation | **CONCENTRATED DOSE** - NOT spread out, takes effect 7:30-8:30 PM |
| Glycine Powder | 3-5g | Daily | Sleep initiation | First dose; final dose at bedtime |
| Taurine | 1000mg | Daily | NAT2 support/GABA | GABA modulation, calming, detox support |
| NAC | 600-1200mg | Daily | CYP1B1/NAT2 detox | Glutathione support (v2: reduce to evening only) |

**MEAL TIMING**: With dinner (7-8 PM)
**CRITICAL PS TIMING**: Must be 6-7 PM, concentrated dose (NOT bedtime) - takes 30-60 min to work
**FUTURE ADJUSTMENT (v2)**: Move NAC to evening only (blunts daytime energy)

---

### Wind-Down (8-9 PM)

| Supplement | Dosage | Frequency | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Magnesium Glycinate | 400mg | Daily | Sleep preparation | Higher dose for deeper relaxation |

**NOTES**: Begin dimming lights, reducing screen time, relaxation routine

---

### Before Bed (30-60 min before sleep)

| Supplement | Dosage | Frequency | Genetic Target | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Glycine Powder | 5-10g | Daily | Sleep optimization | **THE SLEEP GAME-CHANGER** - temperature regulation, orexin inhibition; v1 using 3g, need to increase to 6-10g |
| Melatonin | 500mcg | Daily | Sleep signal | Perfect dose (less is more) |
| GABA (optional) | 500-1000mg | As needed | Emergency anxiety | Only for breakthrough anxiety/panic |

**TIMING**: 60-90 min before bed for optimal temperature drop
**FORMAT**: Mix glycine in water, juice, or herbal tea
**FUTURE ADJUSTMENT (v2)**: Increase glycine dose carefully to 6-10g (monitor stomach upset)

## Lifestyle Interventions

### Sleep Protocol
- **Target bedtime**: 10-10:30 PM
- **Target wake time**: 7-7:30 AM
- **Duration goal**: 8 hours
- **Sleep hygiene practices**:
  - Dim lights by 8-9 PM
  - Screen time cutoff at 9 PM
  - Cool bedroom (65-68°F optimal for glycine effect)
  - Dark environment
  - Consistent bedtime routine
- **Emergency protocol**: If can't fall asleep after 30 min, get up (don't force it)
- **Early waking**: Give 30 min to fall back asleep; if not, get up
- **Supplements supporting sleep**: Glycine, melatonin, magnesium (distributed), PS

### Breathing Exercises (NEW in v1.5, emphasize in v2)
- **Frequency**: Daily, especially at 1:30 PM
- **Type**: Nasal breathing (primary), box breathing (4-4-4-4), long exhale breathing (4 in, 6-8 out)
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes for box breathing; continuous for nasal breathing
- **Timing**: Especially at 1:30 PM to break 2:30 PM cortisol dip
- **Purpose**: Nervous system regulation, prevent afternoon crash, stress management

### Physical Activity
- **Current routine**: Relatively good shape; recently completed PT for hip
- **Timing**: Flexible, but 1:30 PM activity critical for breaking afternoon crash
- **1:30 PM Activity** (CRITICAL - v2 focus):
  - Options: Cold water splash on face, walk outside, stretching, other movement
  - Purpose: Break the 2:30 PM cortisol dip pattern and avoid energy crash
- **Note**: Hip still has residual tightness in vastus lateralis post-PT (continue stretching)

### Dietary Approach
- **Eating window**: Not time-restricted; distribute throughout day
- **Meal times**:
  - Breakfast: 8:00 AM (with morning supplements)
  - Mid-morning snack: 10 AM (nuts/fats to smooth energy)
  - Lunch: 1:00 PM
  - Afternoon snack: 3-4 PM
  - Dinner: 7-8 PM (with evening supplements)
- **Key Strategy**: Breakfast + 2-hour later fat/nut snack to smooth energy levels
- **Hydration**: [Add daily target]
- **Caffeine use** (v2 addition):
  - Strategic use as supplement for breaking unambitious feeling
  - Timing: [Specify your current use pattern]
  - Type: [Coffee/tea/other]

## Genetic Basis for Protocol

### MTHFR & Methylation Support
- **Your variants**: Compound heterozygous (C677T +/-, A1298C +/-)
- **Enzyme activity**: ~50% of wild-type
- **Supported by**: Methylfolate 2000mcg (effective ~3500mcg with creatine), Methylcobalamin, P5P, TMG, distributed magnesium
- **Rationale**: Impaired methylation causes mood issues, energy crashes, poor sleep; supporting pathway addresses root cause of depression and afternoon crashes
- **Monitoring**: Homocysteine (<10 µmol/L, optimal <7), folate, B12, methylmalonic acid

### CYP1B1 Detoxification (Homozygous L432V)
- **Your variant**: Homozygous CYP1B1 L432V
- **Effect**: Enhanced Phase I (oxidative) activity with increased oxidative stress
- **Supported by**: NAC (glutathione), magnesium (cofactor), glycine (Phase II support)
- **Rationale**: Produces more reactive metabolites; need robust Phase II support
- **Note**: May relate to 25+ lipomas (metabolic/detox issue)

### NAT2 Slow Acetylator (Homozygous R197Q)
- **Your variant**: Homozygous NAT2 R197Q (slow acetylator)
- **Effect**: Impaired Phase II acetylation; accumulation of aromatic amines
- **Supported by**: NAC, taurine, glycine (all support Phase II)
- **Rationale**: Slow acetylation + high Phase I = buildup of toxic metabolites; NAC provides glutathione buffer

### MAO-A & Neurotransmitter Metabolism
- **Your variant**: Homozygous MAO-A R297R
- **Effect**: Altered serotonin/dopamine/norepinephrine metabolism
- **Supported by**: Methylation pathway (all dopamine/serotonin synthesis depends on methylation), PS (mood), glycine (GABA)
- **Connection**: Explains depression and mood instability; methylation support critical

### Other Genetic Considerations
- **BHMT-08**: Homozygous (impacts choline metabolism)
- **Implications**: May need increased choline/TMG; current protocol addresses with 200mg TMG
- **Lipomas**: 25+ lipomas + hyperlipidemia suggests genetic predisposition to lipid accumulation; CYP1B1 detox issues may be contributing factor

## Protocol Adjustments Over Time

### Current Status (December 2024)
- **Methylfolate experimentation**: Started October 2024, had 4-6 weeks relative consistency in November-December
- **Escitalopram adjustment**: Currently titrating (3 days 5mg, 4 days 10mg) after 4 weeks at standard dose
- **Sleep**: Generally improved with protocol
- **Afternoon crashes**: Still experiencing 2:30 PM crash; need stronger intervention (1:30 PM activity focus)

### Recent Changes (December 2024)
- Continued PS at 6-7 PM (emphasizing timing critical)
- Documented glycine as "sleep game-changer" with low effective dose (3g; target 6-10g)
- Identified NAC blunts daytime energy (plan to move to evening only in v2)
- Plan to increase creatine to 5g for better cost-effectiveness and methyl sparing

### Planned v2 Adjustments (January 2025)
- **Breathing exercises**: Add daily nasal breathing routine + 1:30 PM activity to break cortisol crash
- **Creatine**: Increase to 5g via micronized powder (replace inefficient gummies)
- **Glycine**: Increase from 3g to 6-10g bedtime dose (monitor stomach)
- **NAC**: Move to evening only to preserve daytime energy
- **Fish oil**: Move to 3 capsules evening only (morning + evening triggers stressors)
- **Vitamin C**: Add to morning routine
- **Green Tea**: Add to routine (documented research on benefits)
- **Rhodiola**: Research and plan addition for energy/stress (not yet added)
- **Caffeine**: Document current use as strategic supplement for ambition/motivation
- **Remove from protocol**: GABA (never actually used), L-theanine (never used), sulforaphane (discontinued - too expensive)
- **Document**: Breakdown of multivitamin, ideal daily schedule, afternoon crash triggers and patterns
- **Add protocol resets**:
  - 1x/week partial reset day or 1x/month weekend reset (remove some supplements)
  - 1x/6 months full reset (stop everything for few days, gradually add back) specifically for methylfolate

## Monitoring & Effectiveness

### Symptom Tracking (Priority Outcomes)

**PRIMARY SYMPTOM: Afternoon Energy Crash (2:30 PM)**
- **Current status**: Still occurring regularly
- **Target**: Eliminate or significantly reduce via 1:30 PM activity intervention
- **Tracking method**: Daily EVENTS.md entries noting time, severity, what you did, what helped
- **Expected timeline**: 2-4 weeks with consistent 1:30 PM activity
- **Subtypes to document** (v2): Differentiate between:
  - Depression/flatness
  - Pure energy drop
  - Lack of ambition (distinct from depression)
  - Fear responses/anxiety
  - Each may have different intervention (note what each 2:30 PM crash feels like)

**SECONDARY: Sleep Quality**
- **Target improvement**: Fall asleep easily, stay asleep through night
- **Current status**: Generally good with protocol
- **Tracking method**: Sleep quality log in EVENTS.md
- **Lab monitoring**: None specific (clinical observation)

**TERTIARY: Mood Stability**
- **Target improvement**: Reduced depression recurrence, stable mood
- **Current**: On escitalopram, titrating carefully
- **Tracking**: Daily mood ratings (1-10 scale)
- **Medication**: Escitalopram + methylation support addresses multiple pathways

**QUATERNARY: Physical Pain/Tension**
- **Mid-back tension**: Fair amount, especially left side (see diagnoses)
- **Vastus lateralis**: Residual post-PT pain
- **Tracking**: Note correlation with stress, posture, meditation/breathing
- **Intervention**: Breathing exercises, stretching, 1:30 PM activity

### Lab Markers to Monitor

**MTHFR-related (test now, retest in 6-8 weeks)**:
- Homocysteine (target <10 µmol/L, optimal <7)
- Serum folate (target >5.5 ng/mL, optimal >8)
- Vitamin B12 (target >400 pg/mL, optimal >500)
- Methylmalonic acid (marker of B12 function)

**Detoxification-related**:
- Liver function (ALT, AST)
- Estrogen metabolites (2-OH vs 4-OH ratio, due to CYP1B1)
- Check at baseline, then potentially 3-6 months

**General health**:
- Complete metabolic panel
- Lipid panel (for hyperlipidemia management, 25+ lipomas)
- Vitamin D (25-OH vitamin D, optimal >30 ng/mL)
- Complete blood count

**Baseline values**: [To be added when you get recent labs]

### Checkpoints
- **Next lab work date**: [Schedule with PCP]
- **Next protocol review**: January 5, 2025 (v2 implementation)
- **Quarterly reviews**: Every 3 months ongoing
- **Annual comprehensive**: Full reassessment yearly

## Important Notes

### Cost Effectiveness
- Creatine monohydrate: Switch from gummies to micronized powder (more cost-effective for 5g daily)
- Focus on core: methylation support, magnesium, glycine, PS (most impactful)
- Deprioritize: Remove sulforaphane (expensive, not critical)

### Consistency Requirements (Most Important)
1. **Methylfolate timing**: Must be by 10 AM (non-negotiable for sleep)
2. **Magnesium distribution**: Must take 4 separate doses (if skipped, evening panic/anxiety)
3. **PS timing**: 6-7 PM concentrated dose (not spread out)
4. **Glycine at bedtime**: Critical for sleep quality
5. **1:30 PM activity**: Critical for breaking 2:30 PM crash

### Interactions
- **NAC morning dose**: Blunts energy (move to evening in v2)
- **Fish oil**: Morning + evening combination triggers stress responses (move to 3 capsules evening only in v2)
- **Methylfolate after 2 PM**: Disrupts sleep (hard stop by 10 AM)
- **Magnesium timing**: If all taken at night, causes daytime depletion/anxiety

### Tolerance & Long-term Sustainability
- Monitor for glycine dose tolerance (stomach upset above 10g)
- PS effect may plateau; can reduce from 300mg to 100-200mg after stabilization
- Methylation support appears sustainable long-term based on genetic need
- Consider 1x/week or 1x/month partial resets to prevent tolerance
