### Prescription Medications

**Name**: Escitalopram (Lexapro)
- **Generic Name**: Escitalopram oxalate
- **Type**: Prescription (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor)
- **Dosage**: 10mg
- **Frequency**: Once daily
- **Daily Total**: 10mg
- **Start Date**: [Add initial start date]
- **Current Dose Start**: December 2024 (reduced from 15mg)
- **Indication**: Major Recurrent Depressive Disorder
- **Status**: Active
- **Side Effects**: Emotional blunting (primary issue); reduced at 15mg dose due to excessive flatness; persists at 10mg
- **Notes**:
  - Reduced from 15mg to 10mg in December 2024 due to emotional blunting
  - Even at 10mg, emotional flatness ranges from 3-4/10 on good days to 8/10 on difficult days
  - Being addressed concurrently with methylfolate + magnesium supplementation trial
  - Working hypothesis: SSRI blunting may be partially related to folate/B12 deficiency amplifying side effects; supplementation helping to mitigate
  - Bloodwork pending (December 22, 2024) to assess homocysteine, RBC folate, B12, methylmalonic acid

### Dietary Supplements

**Name**: Methylation Multivitamin (Methylated B-Complex)
- **Type**: Dietary Supplement
- **Dosage**: 2 capsules
- **Frequency**: Once daily, morning (with breakfast)
- **Daily Total Per Dose**:
  - **Methylfolate (L-5-MTHF)**: 2000mcg
  - **Methylcobalamin (B12)**: 2000mcg
  - **Adenosylcobalamin (B12)**: 200mcg
  - **Total B12**: 2000mcg
  - **Riboflavin (B2)**: 25mg
  - **P5P (Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate, B6)**: 25mg
  - **TMG (Trimethylglycine/Betaine)**: 200mg
- **Start Date**: October 2024 (trial phase)
- **Indication**: Comprehensive methylation pathway support; address potential folate/B12/B6 deficiency that may be amplifying SSRI emotional blunting
- **Status**: Active / Dosing being refined
- **Dosing History**:
  - **Week 1 (October 2024)**: Trialed 15mg methylfolate equivalent - caused significant overstimulation ("super powers" feeling) with overwhelming sensations; discontinued high dose
  - **November-December 2024**: Reduced to 2 capsules (2000mcg methylfolate) - more stable response
  - **Current**: 2 capsules daily appears optimal; variable effects suggest other factors (absorption, circadian methylation demands, cofactor availability) may modulate response
- **Effects**: Positive response observed; helps reduce emotional blunting on good days, but variability persists (good days 3-4/10 blunting, difficult days still 8/10)
- **Notes**:
  - Timing critical: taken in morning with breakfast (methylfolate after 2-3 PM can disrupt sleep)
  - Genetic basis: Compound heterozygous MTHFR (C677T +/-, A1298C +/-) with ~50% enzyme activity
  - This is a comprehensive formulation vs. methylfolate alone; includes B12, B6, and TMG which are all cofactors for methylation cycle
  - Relationship to escitalopram: May address root cause (folate/B12/B6 deficiency) contributing to SSRI side effects; also supports dopamine/serotonin synthesis
  - Bloodwork pending to assess RBC folate, B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels to confirm bioavailability and sufficiency of current dosing
  - Variability investigation: unclear why same dose produces different results day-to-day; potential factors include GI absorption, magnesium co-availability, circadian methylation cycles, stress level

**Name**: Magnesium Glycinate Blend (Doublewood "Mag 8" formula)
- **Type**: Dietary Supplement
- **Form**: Multi-form magnesium blend (glycinate + other forms per Doublewood formulation)
- **Dosage**: [Capsules - need to verify mcg per capsule from Supplement_Ingredients.md]
- **Frequency**: Multiple daily doses
- **Daily Schedule**:
  - Morning: 1-2 capsules
  - Afternoon: 1 capsule
  - Evening: 1 capsule
  - Before bed: 3 capsules
  - **Daily Total**: 5-6 capsules
- **Start Date**: October 2024 (concurrent with methylfolate trial)
- **Indication**: Support methylation (cofactor), reduce emotional blunting, support dopamine production, address potential magnesium depletion from stress
- **Status**: Active / Ongoing
- **Effects**: Appears to support mood and emotional regulation when paired with methylfolate
- **Notes**:
  - Magnesium is depleted by stress and is essential cofactor for dopamine synthesis
  - Distributed dosing throughout day prevents depletion
  - Glycinate form supports sleep and neurotransmitter synthesis
  - Bloodwork pending to assess serum magnesium (standard labs often miss true deficiency)
