## Lab Panels

### Pending: December 22, 2024 - SSRI Blunting & Methylation Assessment

**Date**: December 22, 2024 (baseline collection; 3-day pause of methylfolate + magnesium supplements)
**Provider**: [Ordering physician/lab name]
**Specimen Type**: Blood (fasting preferred)
**Status**: Pending results

#### Purpose
Testing to assess whether SSRI emotional blunting is related to underlying folate/B12/magnesium deficiency that methylfolate + magnesium supplementation is addressing.

#### Tests Ordered (Critical for Methylation Assessment)

| Test | Why | Target Range | Notes |
|------|-----|--------------|-------|
| **Homocysteine** | Central methylation marker; elevated suggests impaired pathway | <10 µmol/L (optimal <7) | If elevated + low folate/B12 = confirms deficiency hypothesis |
| **RBC Folate** | Tissue-level folate status (better than serum) | >300 ng/mL | Low = supports methylfolate supplementation |
| **Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)** | Cofactor for methylation | >400 pg/mL (optimal >500) | May be masked if folate status inadequate |
| **Methylmalonic Acid (MMA)** | Functional B12 marker | <0.4 µmol/L | Elevated = B12 deficiency even if serum normal |
| **Serum Folate** | Basic folate status | >5.5 ng/mL | Companion to RBC folate |
| **Magnesium (serum)** | Baseline magnesium | >1.7 mg/dL | Note: serum often underestimates intracellular deficiency |

#### Clinical Interpretation Expected
- **If LOW RBC folate + LOW B12**: Confirms methylation pathway disruption; supplementation is legitimate treatment not placebo
- **If ELEVATED homocysteine**: Supports methyl cycle impairment; supplementation justified
- **If markers NORMAL**: Effect observed may be placebo/expectancy, or subclinical deficiency not captured by standard labs; continue if safe and effective
- **If HIGH magnesium**: Unlikely given distributed dosing, but confirms adequate repletion

#### Connection to Current Treatment
- Currently taking methylation multivitamin 2 capsules daily (2000mcg methylfolate + 2000mcg B12 + 25mg B6 + 200mg TMG) + Doublewood Mag 8 blend (5-6 capsules daily)
- Experiencing variable but positive effects on emotional blunting (3-4/10 on good days vs. 8/10 on bad days)
- Paused supplementation for 3 days prior to labs for baseline assessment
- Results will inform whether deficiency is driving the effects and whether to continue, adjust dose, or reconsider approach

## Key Biomarkers for This Project

Focus especially on capturing:
- **Folate & B12**: Essential for methylation assessment
- **Homocysteine**: Methylation pathway marker (elevated suggests issues)
- **Complete Metabolic Panel**: Overall metabolic status
- **Complete Blood Count**: Red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets
- **Lipid Panel**: Cholesterol, triglycerides
- **Thyroid Function**: TSH, Free T3, Free T4
- **Iron Status**: Ferritin, iron saturation (relevant for detox genetics)
- **Vitamin D**: 25-OH vitamin D levels
