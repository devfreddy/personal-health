# Laboratory Results

Clinical lab work from primary care physician. Blood panels, metabolic work, and other biomarkers provide concrete data to assess health status and supplement protocol effectiveness.

## Format

For each lab panel, document:
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Provider**: Lab name and ordering physician
- **Specimen Type**: Blood, urine, etc.
- **Notable Results**: Markers outside reference range
- **Reference Values**: Normal ranges for comparison
- **Clinical Interpretation**: PCP's observations

## Key Biomarkers for This Project

Focus especially on capturing:
- **Folate & B12**: Essential for methylation assessment
- **Homocysteine**: Methylation pathway marker (elevated suggests issues)
- **Complete Metabolic Panel**: Overall metabolic status
- **Complete Blood Count**: Red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets
- **Lipid Panel**: Cholesterol, triglycerides
- **Thyroid Function**: TSH, Free T3, Free T4
- **Iron Status**: Ferritin, iron saturation (relevant for detox genetics)
- **Vitamin D**: 25-OH vitamin D levels
