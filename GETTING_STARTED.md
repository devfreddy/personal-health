- Include diagnosis dates and status
- Note associated symptoms and treatment history

**Time: 30 minutes**

### 3. Add Blood Panel Results
Edit [docs/medical/lab_results/Lab_Results.md](docs/medical/lab_results/Lab_Results.md):
- Add your most recent blood panel
- Focus on the key biomarkers listed (folate, B12, homocysteine, etc.)
- Include dates and reference ranges

**Time: 1 hour**

### 4. Document Current Medications & Supplements
Edit [docs/medical/medications/Medications.md](docs/medical/medications/Medications.md):
- List all prescriptions (especially escitalopram from TODO.md)
- List all supplements you're currently taking
- Include dosages, timing, and frequency

**Time: 1 hour**

## This Month

### 5. Map Out Current Protocol
Edit [docs/protocols/current/Current_Protocol.md](docs/protocols/current/Current_Protocol.md):
- Fill in your daily supplement schedule (using info from step 4)
- Document your daily routine timeline
- Add lifestyle interventions (breathing, activity, etc.)
- Explain genetic basis for your supplement choices

**Time: 2 hours**

### 6. Archive Your Existing Experimentation
From your TODO.md, document your recent protocol work:
- Create dated entries in [docs/protocols/history/Protocol_History.md](docs/protocols/history/Protocol_History.md)
- Document your methylfolate experiment (Oct-Dec 2024)
- Note which adjustments are working
- Explain your reasoning for changes

**Time: 2 hours**

### 7. Create Genetic Analysis Summary
Review your Genetic Genie PDFs and document:
- Key methylation pathway findings
- Key detoxification findings
- How these connect to your symptoms/diagnoses
- Which supplements address which genetic variants

Create a new file: `docs/genetics/analysis/Genetic_Summary.md`

**Time: 2 hours**

## This Quarter

### 8. Begin Systematic Pattern Analysis
Use [docs/analysis/Analysis_Framework.md](docs/analysis/Analysis_Framework.md):
- Analyze your afternoon energy crash using the framework
- Correlate this with genetics, lab data, and what helps
- Document timing patterns from your observations
- Build a hypothesis about root cause

**Time: 3-4 hours**

### 9. Build Your Research Index
Edit [docs/protocols/research/Research_Index.md](docs/protocols/research/Research_Index.md):
- Add papers supporting methylfolate use for MTHFR
- Add papers on cortisol and afternoon crashes
- Find research on supplements you're currently using
- Document how each study applies to your situation

**Time: 2-3 hours**

### 10. Plan Next Lab Work
Based on your genetic findings and current protocol:
- Schedule repeat labs with your PCP
- Focus on markers mentioned in Genetic Genie reports
- Include folate, B12, homocysteine (methylation markers)
- Include whatever matches your genetic detox findings

**Time: 1 hour**

## How to Use This Repository with Claude

Once you've populated the basic structure, you can:

1. **Share the entire docs folder** with Claude for holistic analysis
2. **Ask specific questions** like:
   - "Analyze my genetics, labs, and symptoms - what patterns do you see?"
   - "Review my protocol - are there interactions I'm missing?"
   - "Find research supporting [supplement] for my situation"
   - "Given my genetics and current labs, what should I adjust?"

3. **Continuous improvement**:
   - Update EVENTS.md with daily observations
   - Update TIMELINE.md as you notice patterns
   - Share new lab results for analysis
   - Track protocol changes and their effects

## Tips for Success

### Keep It Organized
- Use consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Link related information across documents
- Archive old versions in history folders
- Update last-modified dates regularly

### Be Detailed But Focused
- Include specific times and dosages
- Note exactly what improved (not just "felt better")
- Record side effects and unexpected benefits
- Document timing - when you take things matters

### Make It Analyzable
- Use tables for easy comparison
- Include reference ranges for lab values
- Link supplements to genetic variants
- Connect observations to interventions

### Maintain Privacy
- This repo contains sensitive health data
- Consider keeping it private on GitHub
- Be careful sharing with untrusted platforms
- Use .gitignore to exclude additional sensitive files if needed

## Example Analysis Workflow

Once populated, here's how you'd use this with AI:

1. **Month 1**: Populate basic structure (above)
2. **Month 2**: Upload docs folder to Claude Project for analysis
3. **Month 3**: Based on recommendations, modify Current_Protocol.md
4. **Month 4**: Run new labs, update Lab_Results.md
5. **Month 5**: Compare labs to baseline, analyze in Analysis_Framework.md
6. **Ongoing**: Daily EVENTS.md entries, monthly review, quarterly deep dives

## Questions to Answer First

Before diving in, think about:
- What is your PRIMARY health concern? (Energy, mood, physical symptoms?)
- What improvements would matter most to you?
- How long do you want to track? (3 months? 1 year? Indefinitely?)
- Are you sharing with a healthcare provider? (Affects what you emphasize)
- Privacy comfort level? (Affects what you document)
